# Survey

### Challenge
> Keith is in a contest with another colleague, to see who can find the hidden message [in the picture](BasicBucketfill.png). However, they're only allowed to use the most basic editing tools!
Can you find out the secret message? 


### Solution
![BasicBucketfill.png](BasicBucketfill.png)
From the original picture, you can see something on it, but it has poor contrast with light yellow and white.

![BasicBucketfill-modded.png](BasicBucketfill-modded.png)
Mess with the colour hue using any basic image editing software. And we see the flag!

The flag is `HHA8`
