### Challenge
> Seeing a non-web exploitation problem Keith prepared their binary and c knowledge, but to their surprise, it was a [.py](exploit.py)! Help Keith learn to exploit python programs.

> Netcat to 104.131.90.29:8005.

> Note- The flag can be mistaken for an error message. 

### Solution

A little search online leads us to [this article](https://medium.com/@GallegoDor/python-exploitation-1-input-ac10d3f4491f)

TLDR;
	
	Since input() is the same as eval(raw_input()), it evaluates the variable as if a number was directly entered

So, we just need to enter the variable name

	$ nc 104.131.90.29 8005
	Enter the password: thisisthepassword
	If you use python 2.7 use raw_input

The flag is `If you use python 2.7 use raw_input`
